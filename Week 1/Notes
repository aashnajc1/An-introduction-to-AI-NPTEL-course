-> Modeling - taking a problem and converting it into a computational problem.

HISTORY:

-> ENAIC : Electronic Numerical integrator and computers. It is the first electronic general purpose computer.

-> It was capable of being reprogrammed to solve a large class of numerical problems at the time.

-> In 1950, Alan Turing(father of computer science) proposed to consider the question, 'can machines think?'

-> You will over time see that communication with the world by observing or by looking at the environment perceiving the moment and then producing an output is
critically important for us to judge whether there is an AI system sitting in there or not

-> The only way to figure how a machine thinks, is by asking it questions and creating a scenario where we can judge its decisions.

-> Alan Turing said that the turing test is a good test to figure out whether a machine thinks or not.

-> Four people ,called the founding fathers of AI came up with a project proposal, in which they propose a 2 month 10 man study of AI be carried out during the summer of 
1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.

-> Marvin Minsky from MIT built one of the first neural network learning machine.

-> 1950 - Turing Test for machine intelligence

-> 1956 - AL was born at Darthmouth college workshop

-> 1964 - Eliza: the chatbot psychotherapist

-> 1966 - Shakey - general purpose mobile robot
